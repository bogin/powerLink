 It was really fun to play with React! Thanks:)  


For running my application -   
   
 git clone https://github.com/amazonKeed/assigment.git  
 cd assigment  
 npm i   
 npm start.  
   
 If your default browser didnt opend, please visit  
 [teams table](http://localhost:3000/teams)  

 
 As for th e assignment itself -   
 I Have some ideas to ease candidates such as me:  
  -     1. Provide the API source -  
              As I was looking for one, I noticed that RapidApi  
              is controlling most of google results on API's,  
              It was hard for me to find a free API which   
              does not require my credit card.  
              Beside that the search for one took was a long time.  
     
  -     2. You mentioned in the assignment that style is not required  
              That's awesome! but right after that-  
			  you wrote that its recommended to use Styled Components.  
              Its confusing.  
              I used a table from a tutorial I learned.
			  I looked at the documentation of Styled Components,  
			  and if I didn't had the tutorial CSS,  
              I could not use the styled components unless I used styled -  
              which is not required ... So I suggest, ask for an assignment without  
              style or with styled components, instead of both.
