- It was really fun to play with React! Thanks:)  
-   
- As for th e assignment itself -   
- I Have some ideas to ease candidates such as me:  
  -     1. Provide the API source -  
      -        As I was looking for one, I noticed that RapidApi  
      -        is controlling most of google results on API's,  
      -        It was hard for me to find a free API which   
      -        does not require my credit card.  
      -        Beside that the search for one took was a long time.  
  -   
  -     2. You mentioned in the assignment that style is not required,  
      -        that's awesome! but right after that you wrote that  
      -        its recommended to use styled components.  
      -        Its confusing.  
      -        On of the React tutorial I learned has a table, so I used  
      -        the CSS from there, then I looked on the documentation  
      -        of styled components, and if I didn't had the tutorial CSS,  
      -        I could not use the styled components unless I used styled -  
      -        which is not required ... So I say, ask for an assignment without  
      -        style or with styled components, instead of both.

- For running my application -

- npm i   
- npm start.
